```ini
[Setup]
AppName=RaceAssist
AppVersion=1.0.0
DefaultDirName={autopf}\RaceAssist
DefaultGroupName=RaceAssist
UninstallDisplayIcon={app}\steering.exe
OutputDir=output
OutputBaseFilename=RaceAssist Setup
SetupIconFile=raceassist.ico
Compression=lzma
SolidCompression=yes

[Files]
Source: "dist\steering.exe"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion

[Icons]
Name: "{group}\RaceAssist"; Filename: "{app}\steering.exe"
Name: "{userdesktop}\RaceAssist"; Filename: "{app}\steering.exe"; Tasks: desktopicon

[Tasks]
Name: "desktopicon"; Description: "Create a &desktop icon"; GroupDescription: "Additional icons:"
```

Just save that as `RaceAssist.iss`, open in Inno Setup Compiler, and click **Compile**.

Would you like me to:

* Auto-copy all assets and DLLs into installer?
* Include a readme or splash screen during setup?

I can package all that too.
